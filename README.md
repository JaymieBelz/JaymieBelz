Holla!

I’m James Bello. I'm an engineering student of @AltSchoolAfrica. I am energetic and motivated to learning new ideas and cloud ☁️ related stuff. I look forward to working with people who are more experienced than me.
Also,I’m interested in both men and women, contributing to open source projects and meeting new people.
